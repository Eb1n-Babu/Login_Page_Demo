User Management Django Demo
Overview
This is a Django-based demo project that allows users to create accounts, log in, add data, and delete data. It serves as a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing user data. This is a demo project created some time ago, and I decided to upload it after many days for future reference.
Features

User Registration: Users can create accounts with a username and password.
User Login: Authenticated users can log in to access the system.
Add Data: Users can add data entries (e.g., notes, profiles, or custom records).
Delete Data: Users can delete their data entries.
Secure Authentication: Passwords are hashed using argon2-cffi or bcrypt for security.

Technologies Used

Backend: Django 4.2.7, Django REST Framework 3.14.0
Database: SQLite (default, via db.sqlite3), with support for MySQL or PostgreSQL
Authentication: argon2-cffi and bcrypt for password hashing
Frontend: Django templates (in entry/templates and Login_Demo templates)
Styling: CSS files in entry/static/css/style.css
Other Libraries: 
django-cors-headers for CORS support
django-suit for admin interface styling
pandas, numpy, matplotlib for potential data processing (if applicable)
whitenoise for serving static files



Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>


Set Up a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the following:
SECRET_KEY=<your-django-secret-key>
DEBUG=True  # Set to False in production
DATABASE_URL=<sqlite:///./db.sqlite3 or mysql://user:password@localhost/dbname or postgresql://...>
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1


Run Database Migrations:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate


Create a Superuser (Optional):
python manage.py createsuperuser


Run the Development Server:
python manage.py runserver

The application will be available at http://localhost:8000.


Usage

Register an Account:

Navigate to /register (or the designated registration URL in entry/views.py or Login_Demo).
Enter a username and password to create an account.


Log In:

Go to /login (or the designated login URL).
Enter your credentials to access the system.


Add Data:

Use the interface (e.g., a form in entry/templates or Login_Demo templates) to add new data entries.


Delete Data:

Navigate to a data management page and select entries to delete.


Admin Interface:

Access the Django admin at /admin to manage users and data (requires superuser login).

Future Improvements

Add data update functionality (edit existing entries).
Implement form validation and error handling.
Enhance security with CSRF protection and stricter CORS policies.
Improve the frontend with better CSS styling or a modern framework.
Add unit tests for entry/tests.py and Login_Demo/tests.py.
Resolve potential typo in manageS.py (likely meant to be manage.py).

Notes

This project was created as a demo and may lack production-ready features like rate limiting or advanced error handling.
For production, set DEBUG=False, use a production-ready database (e.g., PostgreSQL), and serve static files with whitenoise or a CDN.
This project was uploaded on July 13, 2025, many days after its initial creation, so please review and update as needed.
Use this README as a reference when revisiting the project.
